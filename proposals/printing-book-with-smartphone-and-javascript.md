# Printing a Book With a Smartphone and Some JavaScript

Do you prefer print books or ebooks?
Do you prefer print pictures or Instagram pictures?
And what if we could have all of them at the same time?

I'll illustrate the journey of a digital bit from your smartphone's camera to its equivalent on a print book.
This journey involves Instagram, Google Apps Scripts, Blogger and a third-party printing service like Blurb.

And maybe, maybe we might print the book of the conference together ;-)
