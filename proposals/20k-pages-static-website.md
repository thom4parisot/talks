# On Building a 20K Pages Static Website

In 2000, the trend was to build a dynamic Ajaxified mashup.
In 2013, the trend is to host a static website on Github Pages.

Does it scale for 20K pages? And what if we have contributors?

This is a story on how I migrated a community driven PHP/MySQL website to a pure static website generated with **Node.js**:
architecture, caveats, optimisations and how people perceived the new philosophy of *everything* becoming editable.

You will eventually learn how to deploy such a website from a mobile phone on a 3G connection!
